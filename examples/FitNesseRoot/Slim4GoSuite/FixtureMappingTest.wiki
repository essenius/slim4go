This demo shows how you can use fixture fields and methods in test scripts.
You can optionally use set (when setting) or get (when getting) as part of the command.
Note you can only use public fields or methods.

!|script  |Fixture Mapping       |
|set Field|[a, b, c]             |
|check    |Field       |[a, b, c]|
|check    |get field   |[a, b, c]|
|Method 1 |[d, e, f]             |
|check    |get method 2|[d, e, f]|
|check    |field       |[d, e, f]|
|Field    |[g, h, i]             |
|check    |Method2    |[g, h, i] |
