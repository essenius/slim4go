This demo shows that different instances of a fixture have different data
It also shows how you can temporarily set aside a fixture via push and pop.

!|scenario|R2D2 differs from|id   |
|push fixture                     |
|start    |memo object      |R2D2 |
|check    |data             |R2D2 |
|check    |ID               |!=@id|
|pop fixture                      |

!|script          |memo object|C3PO|
|check            |data       |C3PO|
|$id=             |ID              |
|R2D2 differs from|$id             |
|check            |data       |C3PO|
|check            |ID         |$id |
