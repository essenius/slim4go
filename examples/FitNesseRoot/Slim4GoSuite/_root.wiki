This suite shows a number of demos for slim4go.
It uses the fixtures defined in the examples/demofixtures folder

These variables are needed to configure FitNesse for slim4go
!define TEST_SYSTEM {slim}
!define COMMAND_PATTERN {%m}
!define slim.flags {-s 2 -t 30}

Activate the following variable to the right location. 
!- Mac/Linux: !define TEST_RUNNER {/path/to/cmd/slim4godemo/slim4godemo} -!
!- Windows: !define TEST_RUNNER {c:\path\to\cmd\slim4godemo\slim4godemo.exe} -!

You can also set these variables in plugins.properties as follows:

TEST_SYSTEM=slim
COMMAND_PATTERN=%m
TEST_RUNNER=/path/to/cmd/slim4godemo/slim4godemo
slim.flags=-s 2 -t 30 

Note that not all these tests pass - that's on purpose, as some show the capabilities slim4go has to report back issues
